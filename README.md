## What is this?

I like to keep an eletronic version of my class notes, along with the files the teachers have distributed.  
This is just a nested up version of all these, linked and embellished with html, css and javascript.  

## How do I use this?

A server should be set up properly, so just click the link,  
and you'll be able to navigate through the files easily.  


## Ps.  

- Feel free to contribute if you have some knowledge with `html`, `markdown`, `javascript`, `git`, etc.
- Really, learn `github`, it's more convenient than google drive.
- Links with `(down)` are literally *down*; links with `(to be updated)` are obsolete.
